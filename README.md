# Inversion-Count

we find inversion count using divide and conquer paradigm.
We merge sort the two parts of the array and then also find 
the number inversions while merging the two arrays.
So the final answer is the inversion from the left sorted array
inversion from  the right sorted array and the inversions while 
merging the two arrays.
